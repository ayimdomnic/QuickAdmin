# QuickAdmin
Get your laravel Up and running 

# WHY?

Well laravel development involves abunch of redundant processes that you could actually save time while reusing code.
I personally get to make alot of multi-auth apps and every single time I have to do everything ground up

#CONCEPT

All the above into conciderations I have resolved to device a quick admin package that tackles all the admin, roles and permissions CRUD, Ofcourse this is suited to help me at maximum buit you can fork the repo and edit it to your own preferences or contribute to make it better for everyone. 

#To Do

1. pick an admin theme that's conventional and looks good (The user only cares about the UI)
2. same for the front end

#More

this is mostly for laravel but could be customized for general PHP


#Resources

Twig templating

StyleCI
